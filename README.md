# Notes

* Be aware that I didn't spend much time on UI of this project.

* main purpose of this project is to improve my skills and learn new things as a junior programmer.

* the authentication of this project is JWT based.

* when using API if user is not logged in gets latest 15 posts and if they are logged in get posts of their followers and suggest some posts to them (for detecting if a post is suggested or not, you should check if the user is following the author of post)

* this website is hosted for free on [pythonanywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/).

* beacuse the website is free hosted it's a little slow

* the media that users upload will be stored on server not on a cloud platform (because of some limitations) and only image types accepted because of that.


* django channels (web socket) implemented but the free plan won't support it. so you can not use the chat section on live version but in local it will work.


* API uses [cursor pagination](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/#cursorpagination) when fetching large data for improving response time.
